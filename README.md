## CentOS does not enable networking by default (ugh)

* bento/centos-7.6 has fixed the networking issue. 

Building the box, you need to make some changes. In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, edit the ifcfg-interface and change 

	ONBOOT=no to ONBOOT=yes

Networking: https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/CentOS7
